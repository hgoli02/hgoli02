### Hi there I am Hossein GoliðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Engineering student at the Sharif University of Technology. I generaly relish mathematically inspired fields and as such i am excited about Machine Learning in general.
I enjoy both the theoritical and practical side of Machine Learning as the enjoy of seeing your algorithm work is like no other.
